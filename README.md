# API Management Open Ranking Initiative

## Introduction: The Problem with Private Rankings
Choosing an API Management Platform (APIM) can be overwhelming.  Numerous vendors exist, and comparisons are often biased or opaque, making it difficult to select the right tool for your needs. Private rankings from analyst firms or consultancies can lock you into their perspective and limit your options.

This open-source project aims to address this challenge by providing a transparent and user-driven approach to APIM benchmarking.

## Our Vision: Openness and Transparency
We believe that open and transparent information empowers users to make informed decisions.  Our project offers several advantages:

- Unbiased Information: Freely available information on a comprehensive set of APIM solutions.
- User-driven Benchmarking: Leverage real-world user experiences to assess different platforms.
- Standardized Framework: A consistent methodology for evaluating APIM solutions.

## How it Works
The core of this initiative is a collaborative effort to gather data on various APIM solutions.  The following diagram outlines the process:

1. Identifying Candidate Providers: We will create a list of major APIM vendors.
1. Prioritizing User Requirements: A well-defined framework will be established to weigh different APIM features based on user priorities.
1. Providers Evaluation: Information on each provider will be collected through product documentation, vendor interviews, and user experience surveys.


## Get Involved!
This project thrives on community participation. Here's how you can contribute:

- Share Your Expertise: If you have experience using APIM solutions, contribute to our user surveys and assessments.
- Help Us Grow: Spread the word and invite others to join the initiative.
- Provide Feedback: We value your input! Share your suggestions and ideas for improvement.

Together, we can build a valuable resource for the API Management community!
